			Butterflies are insects.A butterflyâ€™s lifecycle is made up of four parts, egg,
			larva (caterpillars), pupa (chrysalis) and adult.Butterflies attach their 
			eggs to leaves with a special glue.Most caterpillars are plant eaters 
			(herbivores).Fully grown caterpillars attach themselves to a suitable twig 
			or leaf before shedding their outside layer of skin to reveal a hard skin 
			underneath known as a chrysalis.An adult butterfly will eventually emerge 
			from the chrysalis where it will wait a few hours for its wings to fill with 
			blood and dry, before flying for the first time.Butterflies can live in the 
			adult stage from anywhere between a week and a year, depending on the species.
			Butterflies have four wings.Butterflies often have brightly coloured wings with 
			unique patterns made up of tiny scales.Most butterflies feed on nectar from 
			flowers.Butterflies have taste receptors on their feet.Scientists estimate that 
			there are between 15000 and 20000 different species of butterfly.Birdwing 
			butterflies have large, angular wings and fly in a similar way to birds.
			Monarch butterflies are known for their long migration.
